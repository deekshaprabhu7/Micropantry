2. Adafruit BME680 Library (For BME680 sensor functionality)
3. bsec2 (For BME680 sensor functionality)
4. BME680x Sensor Library (For BME680 sensor functionality)
5. Adafruit MPR121 (For weight sensor funtionality)
6. Seeed Arduino SSCMA (For camera functionality)
7. Eigen (For camera functionality)


The following boards are installed:
1. esp32 by Espressif Systems

**Note: DO NOT install 301RC1 version (It gives HTTP related errors for Adafruit IO examples when compiled. Use other stable versions like 3.0.5)**
